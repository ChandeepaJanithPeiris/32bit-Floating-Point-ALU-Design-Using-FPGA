### This is the Individual Project of EN3021 Digital System Design Module
This is a ongoing project to design a 32-bit Floating Point Arithmetic Unit using the IEEE 754-2008
standard for single precision. This unit supports addition, subtraction multiplication and division
operations. This project mainly focuses on the performance optimization and resource efficiency, to
achieve fast calculation speeds with minimal logic resource usage.
